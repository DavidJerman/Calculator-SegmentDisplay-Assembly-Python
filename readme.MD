# HIGH SCHOOL ASSEMBLER PROJECT
A project with assembly for ATmega328 and Python (2018).

The idea is to send numbers from the Python GUI to the Arduino
(programmed in assembly) and use Arduino to calculate the received
equation and then return the calculated values. These values are 
then displayed on a segment display connected to the Arduino.
